# Restaurant Page Project

This project dynamically renders a basic restaurant homepage using JavaScript.
The intent of this project is to practice using webpack and DOM manipulation.

## Pre-Project Thoughts

Hmm. More different ways of programming in JavaScript. ES6 Modules, the Module Pattern, Factory Functions, IIFEs, NPM vs Yarn, Webpack, Prototypal Inheritance, ES6 Classical Inheritance syntax. So many concepts/tools at once. Kind of overwhelming. Ah, well. Here we go anyway.
